# Welcome Labs 32

Welcome labs 32! Congratulations for making it to labs! For labs, you get what you put in. I hope you all make this a meaningful experience and use it as a chance to push yourself and expand on your developer skills.

# Overview

With that being said, we build a greenfield project called Reach LMS for you to expand on. I would take some time familiarizing yourself with the structure of the frontend. Go through each file and get a feel for where things are. At the same time, fire up 'npm start' so you can see the application in action and what components are rendered to each URI (/courses). I would also study the state folder extensively. We built this product with redux and this is where all your local state management will be. A refresher on redux would be helpful in week 1, but if you keep at it, you'll be a proficient redux developer by the end of labs! Redux-logger in the browser console will also be your best friend for debugging! Play around with the app, click around and see what redux actions and http requests are called with each button click. You'll be spending the majority of your time in the components and state folders.

# Frameworks/Libraries/NPM Packages

# Conclusion

Most of your time might be spend on the ModuleText.js component where the real learning happens for our users. Good luck and give labs your all! Trust me you won't regret it!
